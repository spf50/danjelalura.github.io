This is Danjela! I am a computer science major based in Greece, and this blog/portfolio is my go-to place to share my views, ideas, and experiences with the world! 

I am momentarily focused on initiatives that improve diversity and inclusion within the local tech communities I belong to. 

I have just started an [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) chapter in the city of Thessaloniki, and I am working on officially kick starting the chapter by hosting a workshop related to functional programming (which I love) in R. I would love to move to open data later, so please ping me in case you would like to become part of R Ladies Thessaloniki.
