> What am I going to do after Outreachy
<!--more-->

It’s been a few weeks since I last posted about my internship. 

Now that only one month is left until my [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship is completely over, I need to start thinking about the new opportunities that might open up. 

This September, I enter my third year of studies, and most likely I will dedicate myself to school related activities for the following 6-9 months. 
I will probably use my free time during that period to explore new things and/or volunteer. 

Something I’ve always wanted to learn about is containerization and the whole DevOps culture. My knowledge of these set of practices is almost zero so I guess it would be nice to at least read something on them. 
Among the things I’ve wanted to do but haven’t had the opportunity to is also taking some Data Science classes. I know I have to learn some more math before I do that, and I don’t really have a well defined plan that could help me get started, but I’m eager to learn. 

In terms of volunteering, I am looking forward to contributing translations in Albanian to [GNU Guix]() because while working on [“Improve Internationalization Support for the Guix Data Service”](https://github.com/spf50/data-service/projects/1) I noticed that there were no translations in Albanian. 
I’d also like to be more involved in volunteering at on-campus activities, as that would probably open opportunities for learning new things. Starting a club would be a good way to give back to the school community but I have to figure out what the club should be about and how creating one works.

I know this post looks more like a messy bucket list than a post where I write about the potential career paths after Outreachy, but my time commitments (school) don’t permit me to have a full time job. 

However I will be looking for a position once my second semester is over. In the meantime, I am going to be learning new things, volunteering, dealing with school stuff, or improving what I already know.
